# MobileInsight-Cloud

**MobileInsight-Cloud** is a cloud-based iteration of the original [MobileInsight](https://github.com/mobile-insight/mobileinsight-core/tree/ubuntu22-py310) tool, designed to enhance accessibility and streamline functionality. With this version, users can visualize, filter, upload, and download logs directly from a client machineâ€”eliminating the need to install MobileInsight locally.  

This cloud solution leverages [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a powerful framework for building and sharing interactive data applications, to provide a user-friendly interface. For data storage, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is utilized to ensure efficient and scalable management of log files.  

MobileInsight-Cloud is your go-to platform for seamless log management in a cloud-based environment.
